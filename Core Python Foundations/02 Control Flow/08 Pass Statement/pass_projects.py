# Pass Projects
# Purpose: Apply Pass Statement through 5 projects (Basic to Advanced).
# Structure: Each project is separated by %% and includes description, tasks, and best solution.
# Note: Solutions are designed for clarity, efficiency, and beginner learning.

# %% Project 1: Price Placeholder
# Difficulty: Basic
# Description: Placeholder for price processing logic.
# Objective: Practice pass in if-else.
# Tasks:
# - Create a variable for price.
# - If price > 500, pass; else print "Budget price".
# - Print a completion message.
price = 400
if price > 500:
    pass
else:
    print("Budget price:", price)
print("Processing complete")

# %% Project 2: Product Skip Placeholder
# Difficulty: Basic
# Description: Placeholder for specific product processing.
# Objective: Use pass in for loop.
# Tasks:
# - Create a list of products.
# - Loop over products; pass for "Smartphone", print others.
# - Print processed products.
products = ["Laptop", "Smartphone", "Coffee Maker"]
for product in products:
    if product == "Smartphone":
        pass
    else:
        print("Processed product:", product)

# %% Project 3: Stock Placeholder
# Difficulty: Intermediate
# Description: Placeholder for stock level checks.
# Objective: Use pass in while loop.
# Tasks:
# - Create a variable for stock.
# - While stock > 0, pass if stock > 50; else print level.
# - Print final stock.
stock = 70
while stock > 0:
    stock -= 10
    if stock > 50:
        pass
    else:
        print("Stock level:", stock)
print("Final stock:", stock)

# %% Project 4: Category Placeholder
# Difficulty: Intermediate
# Description: Placeholder for category-specific logic.
# Objective: Use pass with dictionary iteration.
# Tasks:
# - Create a list of product dictionaries.
# - Loop over products; pass for Electronics, print others.
# - Print processed products.
products = [
    {"name": "Laptop", "category": "Electronics"},
    {"name": "Blender", "category": "Appliances"}
]
for product in products:
    if product["category"] == "Electronics":
        pass
    else:
        print("Processed product:", product)

# %% Project 5: Function Stub System
# Difficulty: Advanced
# Description: Create placeholder functions for order processing.
# Objective: Use pass in functions with control flow.
# Tasks:
# - Define a function to process orders with pass for totals > 1000.
# - Call function with a list of orders and print processed orders.
# - Print completion message.
def process_orders(orders):
    for total in orders:
        if total > 1000:
            pass
        else:
            print("Processed order:", total)
orders = [500, 1500, 300]
process_orders(orders)
print("Processing complete")
