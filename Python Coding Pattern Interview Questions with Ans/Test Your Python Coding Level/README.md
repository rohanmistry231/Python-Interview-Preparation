# Test Your Python Coding Level

Welcome to the **Test Your Python Coding Level** folder! This directory is designed to help you practice and enhance your Python programming skills through a collection of coding challenges organized by data structure. Each subfolder contains a `PRACTICE_*.md` file with 100 questions, ranging from beginner to advanced levels, tailored for coding interview preparation.

## Folder Structure

- **Dictionary**: Contains `PRACTICE_DICTIONARY.md` with 100 dictionary-related coding questions.
- **List**: Contains `PRACTICE_LIST.md` with 100 list-related coding questions.
- **Set**: Contains `PRACTICE_SET.md` with 100 set-related coding questions.
- **Tuple**: Contains `PRACTICE_TUPLE.md` with 100 tuple-related coding questions.
- **Star & Number Pattern**: (To be added) Will contain `PRACTICE_STAR_NUMBER.md` with 100 star and number pattern questions.
- **String Pattern**: (To be added) Will contain `PRACTICE_STRING.md` with 100 string pattern questions.

## How to Use

1. **Choose a Data Structure**: Navigate to the subfolder corresponding to the data structure you want to practice (e.g., Dictionary, List).
2. **Open the Practice File**: Each subfolder contains a `PRACTICE_*.md` file listing 100 coding questions.
3. **Start Coding**: Select a question, implement the solution in Python, and test your code.
4. **Progress Through Levels**: Questions are organized by difficulty (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert). Start with beginner questions and gradually tackle more complex ones.
5. **Verify Solutions**: Compare your solutions with expected outputs or discuss them with peers to ensure correctness.

## Why Practice These Questions?

- **Interview Preparation**: Covers common patterns asked in coding interviews.
- **Skill Building**: Strengthens your understanding of Python data structures and algorithms.
- **Progressive Learning**: Questions range from basic to advanced, suitable for all skill levels.
- **Practical Application**: Includes real-world scenarios like database manipulation, pattern generation, and data processing.
